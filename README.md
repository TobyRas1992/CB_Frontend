# Frontend Assignment
As part of our hiring process, we would like for you to complete this task. We expect you to use around 4-6 hours on it. It is completely fine if you don't finish everything in that timeframe. The important thing is just that you note down things you might consider adding had this been a real world task. 

There is no single correct answer to this assignment. The important thing is just that you show how you would attack a problem, and be ready to discuss your approach and the pros/cons associated with it. 

## How to submit
Please either create a new Github repository or fork this. Please commit your progress in small chunks, so that we can get a glimpse of how you work by checking the Git log.
